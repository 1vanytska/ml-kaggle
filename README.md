# Predict Calorie Expenditure
This is a small personal project built around the "Predict Calorie Expenditure" playground competition on Kaggle. The goal is to predict how many calories were burned during a workout based on various input features.

I won’t be building a neural network from scratch — instead, I’ll be using existing machine learning libraries to learn how to apply and fine-tune ready-made models effectively.
